## Object-Oriented Techniques Used
- **Encapsulation**: Data is hidden within classes, and access is provided through public methods.
- **Inheritance**: Base classes and derived classes are used to model real-world entities.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods are overridden to provide specific behavior for different classes.
- **Abstraction**: Complex logic is hidden behind simple interfaces.

## Project Structure
The application uses four major text files to store and manage data:
- `social_network_pages.txt`: Contains information about social network pages.
- `social_network_users.txt`: Contains user data.
- `social_network_posts.txt`: Contains posts made by users.
- `social_network_comments.txt`: Contains comments on posts.

## File Handling Techniques
The application reads data from these files to build and simulate a social network environment. Techniques used include:
- **Reading Data**: Reading user, page, post, and comment data from text files.
- **Writing Data**: Writing updates back to the text files as the application runs.
